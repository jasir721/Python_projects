This is a python project to get familiar with SMS API and weathrer forecast API. Twillio SMS API.

I have used pythonanywhere software to run the code daily at 7:00 am and using API it will predict whether it will rain today or not, If it will rain today then it will send an SMS to my phone number and alert me to pick my umbrella while travelling.
